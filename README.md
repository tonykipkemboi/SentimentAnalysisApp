# Welcome to my Sentiment Analysis demo App!

This is a simple `sentiment analysis app` which scrapes `Yelp reviews` and scores the sentiment. 

The sentiment scores range from 1-5 ( ...think, `1 star` -> ⭐ and `5 star` ->⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)

The app uses a pre-trained `BERT` model (`nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`)

I am still exploring different use cases I can adapt to the app.

`Streamlit` is the UI for this app.

This is for educational purposes only!

Enjoy :heart:
